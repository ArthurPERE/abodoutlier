Description: Performs angle-based outlier detection on a given dataframe. Three methods are available, a full but slow implementation using all the data that has O(n³) complexity, a fully randomized one which is way more efficient and another using k-nearest neighbours. These algorithms are specially well suited for high dimensional data outlier detection.
